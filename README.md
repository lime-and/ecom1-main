!What to do
・Website is too barebones so in need of improvement
・Fix deployment to vercel
・include sort,filter etc function like a normal e commerce website


!!!current problems!!!
・when deploying with vercel the pictures isn't loading properly
・Using Stripe as payment isn't working as it doesn't support yen which this project is based on
